# Clarification for FEAT-006: Privacy Policy & Terms Pages

## What is this feature?
This feature provides accessible pages for the platform's Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions. These pages are essential for legal compliance and user trust.

## Why is it needed?
- Legal requirement for digital platforms handling user data.
- Increases user trust and transparency.
- Required for app store submissions and professional credibility.

## Scope
- Two static pages: Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions.
- Both pages must be accessible from the main navigation/footer.
- Content must be available in Arabic (and optionally English for future extensibility).
- Pages must be responsive and load quickly.
- Content should be presented in a clear, readable format suitable for mobile and desktop.

## Out of Scope
- No user-specific policy customization in MVP.
- No interactive elements (just static content).

## Assumptions
- Content will be provided or adapted from standard templates for Syrian context.
- Stack: C# (ABP Framework) backend, Angular frontend.
- No authentication required to view these pages.
